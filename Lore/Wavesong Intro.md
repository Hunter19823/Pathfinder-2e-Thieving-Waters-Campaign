# WAVESONG'S INTRO

The [[Aepiero Isles]] is a large world mostly made up of oceans and seas that stretch for miles.

The [[Aepiero Isles]] are littered with archipelagoes, isles, and islands of all shapes and sizes, Hence the name.

Swashbucklery, Thievery, Adventure, and Treasure await those who travel the seas and many inhabitants of The Isles seek the high life of the seas. However, most lack the drive or guts to rise in the ranks amongst the pirates of the Isles.

Many who set out for their life at sea, never find their way back home.

Those that do return, only return in defeat and on the thinnest shred of sanity anyone could bear.

There are many wonders across the continents of the Isles, stories that will be told in time.

Our story begins on the continent Sithe 'o Thir, In a country named Midlandia.

Midlandia is a country of sparsely strewn villages and the homeland of the Kingdom of Humble.

Midlandia once stretched most of Sithe 'o Thir.

One day, over 300 years ago, a magical rainforest sprouted among the hilly grasslands of Midlandia. Many Midlandians were furious.

The rainforests were too dangerous to traverse and the major ports of Sithe 'o Thir were cut off by the rainforest.

For many years, the Rainforest hasn't been successfully traversed.

Most traders and merchants would venture from Port Terrehn to Pelican Bay to get to Midlandia. However, in the past 90 years, the lighthouse on Komvoz has struggled to maintain a keeper due to it being allegedly haunted.

Without having a midway point to stop along the way, the trade routes to Midlandia have been closed throughout the years.

Now the only way for imports to make their way to Midlandia is by first going through Port Contrabandista.

Due to the unsavory nature of Port Contrabandista, many traveling merchants have given up finding a route to Midlandia, and the economy on Sithe 'o Thir has suffered since.

After what felt like millenia of the people of Midlandia suffering, Elders of The Pomonan Rainforest passed The Treaty of Port Terrehn with the leaders of Midlandia.

The treaty stated that anyone who had justified reason (Fair Trade) to pass through the Rainforest may, as long as they are accompanied by a Descendant of Pomona, and they have an adventurer's license. Licensed Adventurers who stray from the designated path are subject to the magical beings who dwell in the rainforest.

Very few have lived to tell of what lies beyond the path.
