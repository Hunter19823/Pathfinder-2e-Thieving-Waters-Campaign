# START OF SESSION 4 (8/10/24)

Time: 6PM (Nighttime)

We tried to bring [[Faro]] to the ghostly perimeter but he was unable to come with us.

We approach the cellar door with the vine lasher vines on it.
[[Azami]] noted that those vine lashers can see using ground-based echolocation called Tremor Sense.

[[Campaign Characters/Wavesong]] starts the fight by throwing a lit oil flask at the entrance of the lighthouse which ignites three vine lashers as they emerge from the lighthouse.

We kicked those Vinelasher's asses.

We go inside the sellar.

We investigate the barrels, and there were rats that attacked us.
We all got bit once.
I killed them, then heal everyone with my heal spell.

There is a chest that has a hex on it, that we disarmed by unlocking a raft using the key under an anchor near three barrels.
Inside the chest was a statuette of the lighthouse, that we fit into a socket on the wall.

This opens up the room, there is a seven pointed glyph in the center that is glowing purple.
[[Wavesong]] detects that there are hexes at play.
There is an altar on one side of the room.
There is a bookshelf in the north east corner of the room.

The open scroll case houses a ritual scroll titled "Release Ritual" a ritual that releases a binding ritual hex.

> To activate the release ritual, recreate the Glyph components of the hex you wish to release. Place this scroll in the middle of the glyph and set fire to the scroll. 
> If done successfully, the scroll will produce no ash.

A large brazier with a blue flame.

The bookshelf farthest south features historical almanacs from 4600 ~ 4615 (Current year is 4724), 3 books titled "Tomes of the seas" Parts 3 (The Leviathan), 7 (The Hydra), and 9 (The Kraken) and a collection of 4600 Encyclopedias.

>[[Wavesong]] will know that almanacs come out every 5 years.

Encyclopedias come out once a century, these are considered relics of ancient information.

> there is a small white feather bookmarking the fishing section in the year 4611.

The bookshelf to the right of the brazier features a multiple copies of diaries (The Diary of a Lighthouse Keeper's Keeper) 
These have been printed out, possibly for redistribution. 
There are personalized scroll cases in a cast iron scroll rack, which all appear to be locked except 2, which are empty and one that has been left open.
