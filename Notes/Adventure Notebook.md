[[Campaign Characters/Wavesong]] wrote, "Not", above the "Condemned",
[[Echo]] tears off the wood with a crowbar.

# START OF SESSION 4 (8/10/24) (Day 3)

Time: 6PM (Nighttime) on Day 3

We tried to bring [[Faro]] to the ghostly perimeter but he was unable to come with us.

We approach the cellar door with the vine lasher vines on it.
[[Azami]] noted that those vine lashers can see using ground-based echolocation called Tremor Sense.

[[Campaign Characters/Wavesong]] starts the fight by throwing a lit oil flask at the entrance of the lighthouse which ignites three vine lashers as they emerge from the lighthouse.

We kicked those Vinelasher's asses.

We go inside the sellar.

We investigate the barrels, and there were rats that attacked us.
We all got bit once.
I killed them, then heal everyone with my heal spell.

There is a chest that has a hex on it, that we disarmed by unlocking a raft using the key under an anchor near three barrels.
Inside the chest was a statuette of the lighthouse, that we fit into a socket on the wall.

This opens up the room, there is a seven pointed glyph in the center that is glowing purple.
[[Wavesong]] detects that there are hexes at play.
There is an altar on one side of the room.
There is a bookshelf in the north east corner of the room.

The open scroll case houses a ritual scroll titled "Release Ritual" a ritual that releases a binding ritual hex.

> To activate the release ritual, recreate the Glyph components of the hex you wish to release. Place this scroll in the middle of the glyph and set fire to the scroll. 
> If done successfully, the scroll will produce no ash.

A large brazier with a blue flame.

The bookshelf farthest south features historical almanacs from 4600 ~ 4615 (Current year is 4724), 3 books titled "Tomes of the seas" Parts 3 (The Leviathan), 7 (The Hydra), and 9 (The Kraken) and a collection of 4600 Encyclopedias.

>[[Wavesong]] will know that almanacs come out every 5 years.

Encyclopedias come out once a century, these are considered relics of ancient information.

> there is a small white feather bookmarking the fishing section in the year 4611.

The bookshelf to the right of the brazier features a multiple copies of diaries (The Diary of a Lighthouse Keeper's Keeper) 
These have been printed out, possibly for redistribution. 
There are personalized scroll cases in a cast iron scroll rack, which all appear to be locked except 2, which are empty and one that has been left open.

> The open scroll case houses a ritual scroll titled "Release Ritual" a ritual that releases a binding ritual hex. 
> To activate the release ritual, recreate the Glyph components of the hex you wish to release. Place this scroll in the middle of the glyph and set fire to the scroll.

They nearly party wiped us.
Only [[Wavesong]] and [[Faro]] survived the encounter.
We Stabilize [[Azami]] and [[Echo]].
### END OF SESSION 4

## Reading during the night: (Day 3)
During the downtime [[Wavesong]] skims the books in the room.

### The Herbal Alchemist's handbook 
This is a Reference book teaching the different uses of Herbs in Alchemy. Anyone who has this book equiped while making a medicine check gets a +2 to that Medicine check. 
### Herbarium
A Botanical sourcebook: A sourcebook detailing different Botanical components and their many uses. +2 to nature checks to a reader that has committed 2 hours to reading.

### Botanicals, Curses, and Poisons 
This chart is committed to memory and may be referenced without the need to Recall Knowledge.
![[chart_of_spices.png|left|500x500]]
### Dark Rituals 
A diagram of star symbolism is found about 20 pages in. 
For now, The important bits of information Wavesong notices is 

Hexagram - Takes 2 triangles and overlaps them to make a star. 
The initial Triangle is used to summon a spirit while the second is to bind the spirit with the component of the hex. 

Many Magicians use Hexagrams as a beginner's spell to bind a deceased loved one to their home. 

Candles with varied intentions are to be placed at all 6 points of the Hexagram while keeping memory and intention in mind. The candles are to be lit and then snuffed once all 6 candles are burned till their wick is blackened. 

Magic Triangles -  used as landing spots for summoning demons and angels alike. 
It is wise for magic users to place Triangles outside of their protection circles so the demon or angel may have freedom to enter or leave the triangle without disturbing the peace and safety of the magician. 

Heptagrams - Heptagrams are used to represent Harmony and connection between the natural world and our spiritual self. 

There are seven Los Oratos each with a different domain of nature: 
Apollo - Life 
Pluto - Death
Neptune - Water 
Vulcan - Fire 
Minerva - Humanity 
Mars - War
Chronos - Time 

Thus, the days of the week are named upon those facets of nature: 
Apolsday
Marsday
Neptusday
Chronsday
Vulcasday
Minervasday
Plutosday

Many followers of Los Oratos consider themselves to have a deeper connection with the worlds beyond their plane. 

A Hex using a Heptagram is generally used to bend nature.
![[ancient_star_symbols.png|left|500x500]]

### Fairycraft, Magicka, and Trickscraft:
This book is written in Sylvan. It lays out the laws of Faecraft and the expectations of Fairies, Sprites, Elementals, and other creatures of the Fae lands. There are agreed upon rules in illusion magic regarding the limits of manipulating nature that all fae creatures must adopt to retain the structure and integrity of the land. This piece of literature is typically used as a study source material for beings who were not born in Fae society.

### The Joy of Hexes 
A book that acknowledges the negative connotation of Hex magic, but attempts to expose the reader to the more practical uses of hexes in the home. There are hexes about Healing, Protection, Abundance, Harmony, etc. 

There is a bookmark on page 173. 

Page 173 Contains an illusory hex to make your home appear to have no doorway. 
The hex requests a glyph to be painted on the ground before the entrance and for every point of the glyph a candle is to be placed. 
Between each candle a container of the caster's element of choice is to be placed. 
The caster is to sit in the middle of the Glyph donning a focus of corresponding element, channeling their magicka through the focus. 
The candles will briefly light simultaneously and the illusion will appear. 
This hex is not easily broken without a "Release Ritual" scroll handy, where the scroll may replace the caster in placement.

### Jinx and other Cantrips 
A Spellbook used for teaching young elementals simple cantrips and spells that are mostly harmless and useless outside of practice. Such Cantrips include [[Approximate]], [[Deep Breath]], [[Draw Moisture]], [[Eat Fire]], [[Figment]], [[Illuminate]], [[Light]], and [[Prestidigitation]]. With this book handy, anyone could learn 1 of these cantrips with about 8 hours of practice. To learn a second cantrip from this book, the reader must forget the first cantrip and spend another 8 hours practicing the new cantrip.

### The Grimoire of Undine 
A very old and tattered grimoire. The title is in Common, but the text on the inside is all in Aquan.

# START OF SESSION 5 (8/24/24) (Day 4)
7 AM on Day 4
Session starts at 7 AM where we review the reading over the night. 

We solve the illusionary hex in the room.

This allowed water to rush in and open access to a cave.

[[Azami]] took the magic blue focus next to his ritual hex.
The ritual that restricted [[Faro]] to the lighthouse was washed away / disturbed. (We think)

We went down to the docks, [[Wavesong]] noticed more sea snakes below the docks.
We prepared the boat in the middle of the room.
[[Azami]] attempted to go down to the docks unnoticed, but angered the sea snakes.

We killed both sea snakes with only [[Faro]] getting bitten once.

We noticed a cracked snail shell on the dock.
[[Faro]] rushes over to hug the snail shell and hugs him. It's his old pet snail Garry.
[[Faro]] now has a ghost snail on his shoulder named Garry. (Purely cosmetic)

## END OF SESSION 5

# START OF SESSION 6 (10/5/2024) (Day 4)

We are on the boat, there are three paths.

We pull the left lever and it feels like there is no resistant.
We try different combos to no success.

Further down in the cave we hear something that sounds like somebody being kidnapped.

Upon sailing down the left path, Echo perceives a massive thing swimming below us.

Echo told us they saw something below us.

We come across a fork in the water.

We go to the right.

We found a cliff with a massive basket of bread on a cliff.

Echo gave me their rope, and I tied it to myself and flew up a cliff.

There is a lite fire, a rocking chair, and some stale and moldy bread.

The bread basket is bucket sized. It feels as though a baker lives in these caves.

We hear welching further into the cave.

[[WaveSong]] gets back on the boat, and we continue down the cave.

As we come close to the dock, we start to smell large amounts of yeast and shit.

We hear something yelling at us.
We tie off the boat at the dock.

Before us, stands a large glob of bread dough. It has a large amount of ooze.

The Ooze is resistant to piercing and slashing damage, but vulnerable to bludgeoning where it takes a bonus 5 damage.

We kill the first ooze before it gets a turn.
The second ooze approaches us.

Echo and [[WaveSong]] know of Isla De Monstera, (located at the end of Port of Dandistra). last place before Alkatraz, before deathrow).

[[WaveSong]] recalled that most Goblins are great at fixing mechanics.

+120 xp from Oozes

We managed to talk her down. 
[[Fremikin Frem|Frem]] person is no where to be seen. 
[[Nanna Nutbread]] knows [[Farro]]'s Mom.

The Hag locks us in the closet with her experimental yeast ooze.
## END OF SESSION 6
# START OF SESSION 7 (2/9/2025) (Day 4)

The pantry is lined with various ingredients of different types.

Middle of the room is a Yeast-ooze. 
Down the tunnel is a bigger yeast ooze. 
The tunnel leads out into the ocean.

Initiative Starts, battle with the ooze begins.
We beat the absolute shit out of the Oozes.

We find a bag of salt in the pantry, throw it into the water.
The water starts getting cloudy and a swarm of leaches float to the surface.
A stream of bubbles start as a brood leach appears out of the water.
We kill the leach. 
We break open the wall and it flushes into a wide open cave.
There is a water wheel mixing the water.
Faro and Azami are now in the water trying to escape the water.

They manage to escape the water but are being chased by a Water Dragon.

Faro grabs a second Nana's Nut Bread as he tries to escape.

We narrowly manage to escape to the boat and escape the Water Dragon.

Time: 9PM on Day 4

Wavesong sees grey clouds in the distance.
Echo doesn't smell rain.
Azami sees the trees of the horizon.

A green glowing helix spiral forms in front of the party that splits the water apart.

We anchored as the water tears around us.

Out of the water emerges a galleon ship that is dredged in water covered in damage.
ITS A GHOST SHIP.

The Ghost Ship extends a giant board that hooks into our boat.

Faro rushed to jump on the plank.

Followed by Azami, Wavesong, and then Echo.

Faro notices glowing chests, and immediately rushes over to touch it.

Wavesong tells him to ask for permission before stealing.

A disembodied voice tells them "that's not how pirates do things!".

Wavesong says, "Well now you have permission!".

Echo identifies this ship as Captain Black Beard's ship.

Suddenly a Pirate appears before us on the stairs.

The Black Beard Pirate appears before us.

Black Beard will triple our pay if we can find the other pearls.

There are a total of 7 pearls scattered among the islands.

Black Beard shook our hands to form a Pirate's Pact which we were able to will a curse away. (There were tentacles that came from inside our body).

After returning to the ship, I identify the magic within me.
It is a contract pact, a form of curse, that was put on the entire party.
We managed to reach the boat safely.

We sail back to the coast of the Rainforest at Azami's Homeland, and we see the Alarm that an intruder is coming.
We setup camp along the coast and pulled our boat up onto the shore.

Time: 10 AM Day 5

## END OF SESSION 8

# START OF SESSION 9 (7/19/2025) (Day 5)

Time: 2PM Day 5

We woke up at the camp. As we plan the day.
As we are talking about our plans, we see a Leaf Leshy trip in a bush nearby.

A gaggle of Leaf Leshy are trying to fight us.

Wavesong used Alchemist's Fire (Medium).

The Leaf Leshys' were trying to hold Azami for Ransom.
We meet Treeg (penny's character) who is there to bring Azami back to her father. 5k gold coin reward if returned and captives dead.

The party decides to go back to the boat and prepare to move towards the village (which is under attack by leaf chasers).

Wavesong finds some loose change on a dead chipmunk sized Monkey. (60 gold coins).

We fight quite a handful of monkeys and mango vipers sailing through the river.

We reach the final section of the river, and our boat capsizes.

## END OF SESSION 10

# Start of Session 11 (9/6/2025) (Day 6)

Time: 7 AM on Day 6

We talked through the morning, and now it is now the afternoon of Day 6 of our adventure.
Azami has also been gone for 5 days now.

Treeg saw something and went to investigate.

When we wake up, the amber low of the forest is high.
The magic of the forest seems to be high. (Something unnatural could be going on).

The water that we traveled through had an acidic effect on Treeg.

After talking with Azami and Treeg, we know that the Leaf Chasers are a recent threat. They have been growing in number. 
When a Leshi passes, the forest does not feel this weird.
When a Leshi is eaten by the Leaf Chaser, the forest does not react this way.
Only after Azami has left, did these changes start to occur in the forest.
Treeg seems familiar with the issue.
Both Treeg and Azami are able to "read the leaves".
Both Treeg and Azami hazily remembered someone named Jerry Doe who ran the General Store.
Nobody remembers his name, but they know that he was eaten by the leaf chasers.
(Leaf Chasers erase the Leshis)

We see orange smoke in the distant, and move to investigate.

Crushed Fruit, Scorched Bark, and Magical carnage are all around us. 

There are Leaf Chasers with pulsing amber veins and fungal tumors trying to enter into the rainforest. 

After beating the leaf chasers, a larger leaf chaser comes from the forest.
This one is massive, covered in fungal infections.
Wavesong rushes over to a fallen Leshi, adorned in high armor, and brings that mother fucker back from the edge of death.

Wavesong drops a signal whistle next to the fallen elder so that they may call for help if needed.

While at the town, we can buy anything that is Level 3 or lower, except for anything not available in a rainforest. No magic items, no runes, only basic items.

Time: 12 PM Day 6
## End of Session 11

We enter into the villager to go shopping.

# START OF SESSION 12 (2/1/2026) (Day 6)

Time: 1 PM Day 6

We are walking to the medic tent with Alder limping on Bowbasa's shoulder.

Large leaf tent. Humid and warm, column of lite in the center. Light Focused on a pod. Bowbasa is placed into the furrow. 

"Another chaser attack." Trying to keep the battle quiet. Bannana Bell is the nurse. "We can't treat the fallen." The nurses are trying to understand what the nurses are saying. An older nurse is taking Alder's temperature. "We have to finish triage. Just because he is your future father and law..." He then replied, "I order you to triage them." Bowbasa is betrothed to Bannana Bell the nurse. 

Nurse Bannana Bell pushes the withered Alder into the doorway with hanging bannana leaves.

"Wipe his record clean. Put this as an after battle checkup."

We are now waiting in the reception. 

Wavesong gives Azami their 60 gold back.

Bowbasa brings us back. It is painfully bright for those who are not a leshy.

Treeg is told "family only" and was not allowed to follow. 

Wavesong told the receptionist to pass a note to Azami that we can meet on the south side in front of the town center.

We are being led to the fertilizer shop that sells the best fertilizer in town.
We sit down.

Leshy people eat mulch and fertilizer with a fork-like pitchfork.
Treeg bought one to go.
Echo ate some Crog (frog - cow) milk which smells like chicken, but tastes like milk.

Wavesong wants to go to the library. 

Wavesong buys a scholarly journal from the librarian about the panonan village. 
It is the librarian's personal notes about the village.

We need to go to the **Temple of lost souls** to save the tree. There are **at least 7 runes** in the temple of souls, which is needed for the **seeding ritual spell**, they can move her.
Seeding ritual turns the tree back into a seed. The tree is dying. The tree was planted where it is, and the belief is that the tree is somewhere it wasn't planted originally.
At least 3 banana Leshys for the seeding ritual.
Temple of lost souls is two days walk from the tree.
Azami said that they need to be back in seven days.
The elders are waiting seven days to talk about our situation.
The three sages planted the seed here 100 years ago.
Treeg was gas lit into thinking the forest was fine, when in reality it was hurting.

We go back to the tree hospital. We are told to leave fast.
We make it to the gate, Echo critically succeeds at deceiving the guards claiming we are collecting a flower.

It is now 8 PM.

![[world_map_drawing.png]]

We were walking for two hours and then the third hour we got attacked by four bandits.

It is now 11 PM and we are in battle.
We killed all of them.
Faro broke their trident and Wavesong repaired it for 20 hp.

We make campfire for long rest after reaching our destination for camping.

It is now 12 PM.
